# goal manifest's default.xml — see the README's "Manifest wiring" section.
# When repo sync populates thirdparty/store/ automatically, this script
# becomes unnecessary; until then, run it after checkout.
#
# The directory is named "thirdparty" (not "vendor") because Go treats a
# top-level vendor/ dir as its own vendored-dependencies dir and demands
# a matching modules.txt.
